# Stream Network Analysis
<h2>Programming for GIS final project</h2>


This final project evaluated the stream network in Larimer County Colorado.  Minor streams were removed and then sinuosity and slope calculations were performed on the more significant of the Cache la Poudre watershed within Larimer County.  Further the code was designed so that anyone could perform the same calculations in their area if they provide a stream file and the appropriate DEM files.

<br />


<h2>Workflow overview</h2>

- <b>Take user input for calculations</b> 
- <b>Select significant stream reaches</b>
- <b>Find endpoints</b>
- <b>Performe calculations, strait ling slope, stream slope, and sinuosity</b>

<h2>Python code written using PyCharm IDE </h2>
